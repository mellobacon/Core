# Compilation
This is where everything kinda comes together pretty much. It gets a tree, and evaluates it, along with getting any errors during compilation.

# Evaluator.cs
The evaluator takes each expression and well...evaluates them depending on the expression

# Result.cs
This defines which parts makes up a result for the evaluator
